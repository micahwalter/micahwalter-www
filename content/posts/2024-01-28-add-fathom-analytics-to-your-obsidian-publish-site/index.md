Today I figured out how to embed the tracking code for [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) into an [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) website. It's easy.

1.  Create a file in the root of your Obsidian Vault called `publish.js` – You'll need to use an editor like VS Code for this as Obsidian won't handle it.
2.  Add this code to that file, replacing with your actual site code.

```
var fathomSnippet = document.createElement('script');fathomSnippet.defer = true;fathomSnippet.setAttribute('data-site', '');fathomSnippet.src = 'https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js';document.head.appendChild(fathomSnippet);
```

3.  Use Obsidian to publish the `publish.js` file just like any other file.

That's it!
