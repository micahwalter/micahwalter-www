I've been "going live" every Friday for the past six weeks. It's been pretty fun! Each week I spend an hour and a half talking through how I would build something on AWS. It's been heavily focused on building with [Go](https://go.dev) and serverless services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb). I've also been digging into Generative AI with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock) and [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/).

Below is each livestream along with a few selected highlights. Each episode builds on the previous one.

### Episode 1

In this first livestream I went through the process of building a "Hello, World" program in Go and then turned that into something that can run on AWS Lambda. We also learned a little about the Serverless Application Model (SAM). Yay!
